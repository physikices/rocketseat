                <p>
                    You've been acting awful tough lately
                    Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
                    But inside, you're just a little baby, oh

                    It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
                    You don't always have to be on top
                    Better to be hated than loved, loved
                    Loved for what you're not

                    You're vulnerable, you're vulnerable
                    You are not a robot
                    You're loveable, so loveable

                    But you're just troubled
                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot

                    You've been hanging with the unloved kids
                    Who you never really liked and you never trusted
                    But you are so magnetic, you pick up all the pins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Never committing to anything
                    You don't pick up the phone when it ring, ring, rings
                    Don't be so pathetic, just open up and sing

                    I'm vulnerable, I'm vulnerable
                    I am not a robot
                    You're loveable, so loveable

                    But you're just troubled
                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you teach me how to feel real?
                    Can you turn my power on?
                    Well, let the drum beat drop

                    Guess what? I am not a robot
                    Guess what? I am not a robot

                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot

                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
                    Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot.
